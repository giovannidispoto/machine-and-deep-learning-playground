# {Machine, Deep} Learning Playground
In this repository, you will find some of my personal experiments done with ML/DL techniques to improve my confidence with them or curiosity in the outcome.

* [Knowledge Distillation](https://github.com/giovannidispoto/machine-and-deep-learning-playground/blob/main/knowledge_distillation.ipynb) notebook contains an implementation of that technique presented into the paper [Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) by Hinton et al.
* [Diabetes](https://github.com/giovannidispoto/machine-and-deep-learning-playground/blob/main/Diabetes.ipynb) notebook contains an implementation of a Machine Learning pipeline over the [Prima Indian Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), with a little of Data Exploration, Feature Selection with some properties of models like LASSO regularization or Wrapper methods like recursive feature elimination, Hyperparameters optimization with Random Search and ensemble methods of an SVM, Random Forest and Naive Bayes models with stacking ensemble.
